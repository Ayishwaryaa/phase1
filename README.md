**Problem Statement:**
The project aims to create a helpful virtual guide using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant. This virtual guide will be customized to assist users on popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot's primary functions include providing useful information, answering frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offering a friendly conversational experience. The overarching goal is to empower users with quick access to information and create meaningful connections through this virtual guide. 


**Project Understanding: 
Objectives:**


1. To develop a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant.
2. To customize the chatbot's persona, tone, and style of communication.
3. To enable the chatbot to address common user scenarios and FAQs.
4. To design a smooth conversation flow to ensure a positive user experience.
5. To configure responses using Watson Assistant's intents, entities, and dialog nodes.
6. To integrate the chatbot seamlessly with Facebook Messenger and Slack.
7. To ensure a user-friendly and informative interaction with the chatbot.


**Instructions on How to Deploy and Interact with the Chatbot on Messaging Platforms** 
To deploy the chatbot on messaging platforms, we will need to create a Watson Assistant account and create a new chatbot. Once we have created a chatbot, we can train it on the dataset of user queries and responses that are provided in the GitHub repository. Once the chatbot is trained, we can deploy it to messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram. To do this, we will need to create a Watson Assistant integration for each messaging platform.
